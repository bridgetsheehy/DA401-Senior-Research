Social Media Mental Health Impacts
RQ: How does daily screen time among social media users influence key aspects of well-being, including happiness, sleep quality, stress level, and physical activity?
Overview: This analysis explores how social media engagement, measured by daily screen time, relates to well-being metrics like happiness, stress, sleep quality, and exercise frequency. The dataset, Mental_Health_and_Social_Media_Balance_Dataset.csv, includes demographic and behavioral data from social media users.
Files Included: Mental_Health_and_Social_Media_Balance_Dataset.csv – Raw dataset Sheehy--Early-Results--Social-Media.rmd – R Markdown Sheehy--Early-Results--Social-Media.html – Quarto/HTML report output README.md – Study summary and data documentation
Methodology: A series of simple linear regressions performed in R, where Daily_Screen_Time (hrs) is the independent variable and well-being measures are dependent variables. Visualizations include scatter plots with fitted regression lines and coefficient plots comparing screen-time effects across outcomes.
Early Results Findings: Increased screen time leads to lower happiness and sleep quality. Increased screen time leads to higher stress levels. Minimal relationship between screen time and exercise frequency.
